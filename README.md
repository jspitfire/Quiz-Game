## This app involves a timed-quiz with 10 coding questions against a timer which counts down. Each incorrect answer loses you 10 seconds. Scores are logged and a leaderboard is given.

## Features include dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code for the following criteria:
- WHEN the start button is clicked, THEN a timer starts and a question is presented
- WHEN a question is answered, THEN another question is presented
- WHEN a question is answered incorrectly, THEN time (10 seconds) are subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over, THEN your score and initials can be saved and viewed on a leaderboard.
